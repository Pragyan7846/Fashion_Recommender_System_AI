Fashion recommendation system

This project implements a fashion recommendation system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system recommends fashion items based on user preferences and image similarity using deep learning techniques.

Features:

Image Recognition: Utilizes CNNs to recognize and classify fashion items from images.
Recommendation Engine: Recommends similar fashion items based on the features extracted from the CNN.
User Interface: Provides a simple user interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.
Model Training: Trains the CNN model on a dataset of fashion images to learn features and patterns.
Integration with AI/ML: Integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to improve recommendation accuracy over time.

Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language for implementing the recommendation system.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
TensorFlow / PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks used for building and training the CNN model.
Fashion MNIST Dataset: Dataset of grayscale images of fashion items used for model training and testing.
